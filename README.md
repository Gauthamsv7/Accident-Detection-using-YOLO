# Accident-Detection-using-YOLO
An accident detection model is used in which Live CCTV footage is taken as a source.Used YOLOV4 as the detection model such that on detection an email alert will be generated to the respective emergency services.

# Steps to be followed:

# 1. Install the packages
 The respective packages to be installed.
 
# 2. Mounting on Gdrive
As my PC is having low GPU to perform heavy Deeplearning methods.I have choosen Google Colab inorder to perform the task.If working on Local machine this step can be easily ignored.

# 3.Clone the existing YOLOV4

# 4. Make sure OpenCV,GPU etc are enabled or not.

# 5. Copy custom configured file into "cfg" folder.

# 6. Copy the files obj.names and obj.data into "data" folder.

# 7. Copy process.py and run it such that test.txt and train.txt is created.

# 8. Download and run YOLO optimal CNN's.

# 9. Run the code such that you get desired weights in the destination location .Iterations might take a little while all you need you do is to just wait.

# 10. Run the below two functions , you will be getting issues with alert part(gmail) dont planic !!! stackover flow will help you ðŸ˜€.

# 11. Run the below code after getting best weights(Based on the requirement of your project).

# 12 . Accident Detection is performed on Image.

# 13 . Accident Detection is performed on Video.

# 14 . Accident Detection is performd on Live Camera.(Here Laptop camera is taken as source if attacted to CCTV camera make some changes in the code).
